Rules (these might be subject to change):
- No external closed source imports.
- No external open source imports (only with supplied associated open source files which has to be approved before-hand and have the same hash as the approved file, if the hash changes it has to be approved again).
- For now it's just a python script, but that doesn't mean we won't accept other code bases, eventually this is going to be a proper type-1 Hypervisor (Assuming we get the help needed).
- Proper dev notes explaining what the secion of code will do, which part it hooks into and if it's going to interfere with other parts of the project.
- Personally tested code in your own environment before submission, preferably with some sort of visual proof (video preferably, but a detaied screenshot works too).
- All files provided will go through AI, virustotal and personal screening, so paranoia level of scrutiny and we WILL expose you EVERYWHERE if there's a malicious positive (hence the back-up of back-up screening to remove false flagging), so keep that in mind.
